        <p class="lead">Thank you for buying SocketIt - the connection library. SocketIt helps you to connect and
          group things together by providing premade components. You can use it to connect structures
          like LEGO blocks, body limbs, car parts or parts of buildings. It’s also helpful for creating slotted interfaces
          with snapping points or just to connect GameObjects virtually together so that they are able
          to communicate with each other.</p>

        <h4>Components</h4>

        <p class="">SocketIt is split into multiple drop-In components and can be configured to your needs. It makes
        heavy use of the Unity event system and is easily extendable</p>

        <h4>Editor</h4>

        <p class="">SocketIt is fully integrated into the Unity editor with custom windows, shortcuts and gizmos.
        Every feature is usable ingame and inside the editor.</p>

        <h4>State</h4>

        <p class="">All properties are public without any hidden state. You can access, manipualte and serialize them.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Be aware that SocketIt is not a “finished game”.
          You will have to write code so that it integrates into your game. </div>

        <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
        <p class="">Copy the Editor folder from /SocketIt/Assets/Editor into your applications root directory.
          This step is neccessary for Unity to activate the editor features.
        </p>

        <h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
        <p class="">
          In SocketIt modules can be connected with their sockets. A module can have multiple sockets. Imagine a LEGO brick.
          You can connect the brick in various combinations but always limited to the nobs and holes of the brick. A socket in
          SocketIt represents both the knobs and holes.

        <p>Connected modules form a composition. A composition knows everything about its modules and can be used to
        propagate events and information to them.</p>
